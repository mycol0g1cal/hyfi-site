      <h2>What is HyFi?</h2>
      <p>
        HyFi is a private beta application that lets you explore your personal finances with
        strict control over consent and data retention. We connect to your financial accounts
        using <strong>Plaid</strong> so you can review balances, transactions, and spend trends
        with confidence that everything is auditable and reversible.

        <h3>Consent-first</h3>
        <p>
          Every sync is tied to a Plaid Link session and logged with a consent identifier. You decide
          which accounts to connect, and you can revoke access at any time directly from Plaid.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Readable Receipts</h3>
        <p>
          HyFi keeps human-readable receipts for every run (balance summaries, ledger snapshots,
          drill reports) so you always know what data was accessed and why.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Data Retention</h3>
        <p>
          We store Plaid access tokens securely, retain financial artifacts only while you are
          actively using HyFi, and honour deletion requests within 30 days. Tokens are rotated or
          revoked on request.
